Somebody generated a city view in the space. However, the city is very small and our jet is gigantic.

Enter your name before we land to the city.

Press 3 to lunch the jet. All jets are labeled. Because of no atmosphere, all jets will just drop to the ground.

Please use the Module 5 receiver, there will be no terrain in the receiver.
